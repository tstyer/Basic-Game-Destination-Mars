## Introduction

Welcome to the README for my second portfolio project: a JavaScript-based browser game. This document outlines the whole development journey, from initial planning and design choices to implementation and final deployment. It also highlights key features, challenges encountered, and how I applied core front-end skills to bring the project to life.

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive web game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It focuses on creating an engaging user experience through responsive design, smooth gameplay, and accessible controls. The game serves as both a fun, replayable experience for users and a demonstration of my growing proficiency in front-end development, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

### Scope

## User Experience 
...

### Demographics

This game is designed for casual players of all ages 12 and above who enjoy light, engaging browser-based experiences. The visual style can appeal to children and teens, and the challenge-based gameplay and aesthetics are also designed to attract older players, especially those familiar with classic arcade and platform games.

### Strategy

#### Target Audience

- Children aged 8–14 looking for quick, fun web games  
- Teens and young adults who enjoy competitive but straightforward gameplay  
- Adults (20s–40s) seeking casual games with nostalgic or retro appeal  
- Mobile-first users who play games on the go  
- Game developers and designers seeking inspiration or examples of interactive UI design

#### Goals

- Increase traffic and repeat visits through engaging gameplay and visual polish  
- Build a community through social sharing, player feedback, and ongoing updates  
- Offer the game as a portfolio piece demonstrating front-end development and UX skills  
- Potentially monetise through ads, sponsorships, or merchandise, depending on reach and demand

### Structure

The site is divided into clear, intuitive sections:

- **Game Screen** – Core interactive experience with responsive UI  
- **Instructions Page** – Simple, accessible guidance for how to play  
- **Settings Page** – Toggle controls for difficulty, sound, and customisation  
- **Footer** – Includes social links, credits, and accessibility information  

The site utilises Bootstrap and jQuery for its layout and responsiveness, complemented by custom CSS for a unique visual identity.

### User Expectations

Users expect:

- Immediate understanding of the game’s objective  
- Clear navigation with no unnecessary friction  
- Fast load times and smooth transitions  
- Fun, replayable gameplay with feedback 
- Compatibility across devices and browsers  
- The ability to share or compete (e.g. scores or achievements)

### User Stories

#### Target User Goals

- Quickly begin playing without needing to register or download  
- Progress and improve over time with visible feedback  
- Access the game on mobile during short breaks or downtime  
- Feel a sense of reward, progress, or completion  
- Return later and pick up where they left off  

#### New Visitors

As a new user…  
- I want to quickly understand what the game is about so I can decide if I want to proceed to play.  
- I want to browse the instructions page and easily understand how to play the game.  
- I want simple and clear instructions, displayed well with clear fonts and contrasting colours.  
- I want visual feedback, like hover effects so I know my interactions are correctly registered.  
- I want the page to load quickly, so I don’t change my mind and exit before I see the information.  
- I want to be able to play this game on my mobile or tablet.  

#### Returning Visitors

As a returning user…  
- I want to be able to play this game on my tablet or mobile.  
- I want to easily find the social channels of the game so I can follow them.  
- I want to resume where I left off, so I can continue playing without starting again.  
- I want my settings (like difficulty or sound preferences) to be remembered, so I don’t have to reselect them each time.  
- I want to see my previous scores or progress, so I can try to beat them or track how I’ve improved.  
- I want quick access to the core parts of the game, so I don’t have to re-read instructions or click through multiple screens.  
- I want a smooth and fast-loading experience, so I don’t get frustrated and leave the site.  
- I want the design and layout to feel familiar, so I can quickly get back into the flow of playing.  
- I want the option to share feedback or report bugs, so I feel involved and heard as a regular player.

### Space Bug

The space bug was generated with AI at [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/).

I ensured that this image was original. It was paid for by me, and I completed reverse image searches on google to avoid plagiarism.

### Future Design Plans

## Technology Use

- Balsamiq
- Canva
- Visual Studio Code
- Github
- Youtube
- Coolors
- Google Fonts
- jQuery (CDN)

I used the CDN version, allowing me to link to the jQuery file online. This ensured that, if any updates were made during my time using jQuery, those updates would automatically be applied. This would not have been the case had I downloaded the file, which would have allowed me to build the website offline. Had I downloaded the file, I would have pasted it into the JavaScript file within the root folder.
